\section{Performance on Different Networks}\label{sec:methodology}
We begin by measuring how VCAs perform under different network conditions. 
In the first set of experiments, we study the impact of \textbf{bandwidth}, \textbf{latency}, 
and \textbf{loss} on application performance. In the second set of experiments, 
we analyze how these applications respond to new flows on the network.
