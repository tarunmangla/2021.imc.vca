\section{Network context and application performance}\label{sec:methodology}
Here we study how different VCA applications perform under different network conditions. In the first set of experiments, we study the impact of different network parameters such as throughput and latency on application performance. In the second set of experiments, we analyze how these applications respond to transitory disruptions in the network conditions.
