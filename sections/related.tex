\textbf{Performance of Internet applications}
There is also related work on measuring other applications over the Internet including video streaming~\cite{}, web browsing~\cite{}, and online gaming~\cite{}. Our work focuses on VCAs which are characterized by their strict latency requirements and upstream link utilization.  

\textbf{VCA measurement studies}
Early VCA measurement work has focused on uncovering the design of the Skype focusing on the streaming protocols~\cite{guha2005experimental} and architecture~\cite{baset2004analysis, bonfiglio2008detailed, bonfiglio2008tracking}. More recent work including other streaming applications~\cite{xu2012video, nistico2020comparative} highlighting the differences in design of these applications. In this paper, we take a fresh take on the measurement focusing on the application performance and impact of new application modalities on network utilization. 


\textbf{Application fairness}
There is also work on measuring application fairness including fairness among TCP variants, or fairness of TCP vs other UDP-based protocols (e.g., QUIC, WebRTC), or applications. Our work focuses on how VCAs share bandwidth with other VCAs, standard TCP implementations, and also applications with their additional bandwidth adaptation over TCP.
