\abstract{
Video conferencing has been one of the killer applications of the Internet. The video conferencing application (VCA) landscape has recently undergone significant change owing to the ongoing covid pandemic with the introduction of new VCA applications (e.g., Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) or revamping of incumbent VCA (e.g., Zoom, Bluejeans) to facilitate user engagement. The VCAs, however, have differed in their design choices and features. Understanding these differences with their impact on application performance and network consumptions can help in improving the design of future VCAs.  

In this paper, we conduct extensive measurments contrasting the design differences for three popular VCAs, namely Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. We first study the application performance metrics in a 2-person call under different network conditions. We find that differences in application performance under same network conditions which can be attributed to differences in encoding mechanisms, application-level capping, bandwidth estimation techniques. We also found that performance varies across device platform even for the same application (e.g., native client better than the web client). We next study the impact of usage modality (e.g., gallery vs speaker mode in zoom) on network consumption and find some interesting differences in network consumption based on the usage modality. For instance, Zoom typically increases the sent video resolution of the user under speaker mode. Finally, we also study how different VCAs share bandwidth with other applications (file download, video streaming, and other VCAs) in terms of fairness. We find interesting differences wherein we find that applications do not share bandwidth fairly with other internet applications. 
%A systematic understanding of the VCA design and its implications on network-levek performance is can be useful especially for improving the design of these services. In this paper, we conduct extensive measurements to understand and contrast the design of three popular VCAs, namely Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams.
