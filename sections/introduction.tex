\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\begin{itemize}
\item VCAs have been touted as a killer application for the Internet connecting millions of users. Significant research and measurement studies have been conducted benchmarking the VCAs of the time, their design choices and its impact on application performance. 

\item The VCA application has undergone significant change in the covid-era of work from home/school with either new VCAs have been introduced or existing applications significantly revamped.

\item In the context of these changes, it is important to revist the earlier measurement studies especially understanding how these changes relate to application performance and network consumption.

\item In this paper we do a comparative analysis of three popular applications, namely zoom, meets, and teams. 

\item Our analysis compares the VCAs along these three questions: i) How does the application performance vary under different network conditions?, ii) What is the impact of differnt VCA usage modality on network consumption, iii) Are the VCA applications fair in terms of bandwidth sharing when compared to other applications or transport protocols.

\item Insights: We find that ...
