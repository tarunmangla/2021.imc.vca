\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We analyze the network utilization and performance of three major VCAs under diverse network conditions and usage modalities. Our results show that VCAs vary significantly both in terms of their resource utilization and performance, especially under constrained links. The differences can be attributed to different VCA design parameter values, congestion control algorithms, and media transport mechanisms. The VCA response also varies between an uplink and downlink bandwidth impairment. The difference is mainly due to an intermediate server with VCAs using the server differently. Finally, the network utilization changes under different call modalities. This can be explained by the changes in the video layout on the user screen, ultimately leading to changes in the sent video resolutions. Future work will extend the analysis to more VCAs, device platforms, and network impairments.
